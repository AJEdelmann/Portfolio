            For businesses, I create all sorts of artworks: websites, apps, ads,
            identities, documents,…
            <br />
            For web companies I can work as a Web Developer, helping on user
            experiences, user interfaces, code development and production.

            After working for Engineering companies selling planning, management
            and execution for eleven years, <br />I decided to turn my hobby
            into my profession and started to invest time and energy in order to
            become a Full Stack Web Developer. <br />I enjoy bridging the gap
            between the offline and the online worlds, so keep doing just that.
